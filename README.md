# BirdOffice-exo

This is the test I did for Bird Office.

## Getting Started

You need to have Node on your computer.

Then, you have to :
1. Clone the repo
2. Install node modules using this command :
```
npm install
```
3. Run the app using this command :
```
npm run start
```
4. Then go at this address on your browser :
```
http://localhost:3000/
```


## SASS

If you want to collaborate to this project by adding new styles, you can add it to the file ```/src/scss/styles.scss``` and then run the command :
```
sass src/scss/styles.scss src/css/styles.css
```

## Architecture
- node_modules
- src
  - assets (all the pictures I used)
  - css
  - js (empty for now)
  - scss
- index.html (the main file)
- package.json
- server.js
- webpack.config.js
